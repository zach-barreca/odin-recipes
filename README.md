# odin-recipes

This is a basic recipe website created by Zach Barreca under the 
instruction of The Odin Project. I created this website in order to
practice all of the HTML knowledge I have acquired. I revisited this
project and added some basic CSS. In the future I would like
to come back and finish out the look with a more in-depth styling.
